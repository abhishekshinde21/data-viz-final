                    <p class="lead"> Defense is critical for preventing opponents from scoring. In football, the
                        goalkeeper and defenders are essential for a defense composition. The saying goes, "The best offense is a
                        good
                        defense". Well, Manchester City exemplified the best defense along with the offense this past
                        year.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="lead"> The team had the highest clean sheet percentage of 50.0, meaning that they had the
                        most games in
                        which they prevented the opponent from scoring at all. This measure enabled the goalkeeper to
                        win the Golden Glove award. In addition, the team allowed only 32
                        goals throughout the season, which was the least. This defensive superiority inevitably
                        contributed towards their top placement in the league. Overall, from all of the charts, we can
                        see how Manchester City was the strongest side of the 2020-2021 season in the Premier League.
