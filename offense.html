                        Manchester City (MC) did a lot of that this past season. Not only that, but they scored
                        intelligently by
                        producing numerous assists, which are player contributions to score goals. From the
                        scatterplot above, it is evident that MC was the dominant offensive team with 82 goals and 55
                        assists. Not only that
                        but this team averaged the highest goals per 90 minutes of 2.16. MC had a robust offensive lineup, including
                    the playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, and new generational talents like Phil Foden, which contributed towards these results. </p>

                    <p class="lead">Other renown teams who finished in the top half of the standings, such as Manchester
                        United and Liverpool, also showed good offensive statistics. These teams can be found
                        in the top-right aspect of the scatterplot. Also, the chart shows a correlation between the
                        number of goals scored and assists produced. Next, press the button on the bottom right to see how MC led in possession.</p>
