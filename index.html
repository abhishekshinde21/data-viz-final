                    <p class="lead">In the Premier League 2020-2021 season, Manchester City (MC) finished at the top of
                        the
                        standings with an
                        exemplary record of 86 points, consisting of 27 wins, five draws, and six losses. This was 12
                        points higher than
                        the second place team, Manchester United, which is really impressive. Throughout the season, it
                        was
                        clear that MC would prosper with
                        their
                        football intelligence, possession-focused style of play, and talented squad in both offensive
                        and
                        defensive ends.
                        Here is a deeper look into how MC dominated the game of football this year. </p>
